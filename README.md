# What is this??

The website as a whole was made for a university class. The final project of this class was a "free-for-all make whatever you want" website. I decided to remake an older terminal Java project into a native JavaScript web app.

The game is [here](https://plantyplushy.github.io/WebDev-Website/project/home.html)

## Future plans

I want to:
- Refactor the project so that it's using react instead of barebones javascript, HTML and CSS
- Make this app phone screen compatible
  - On this note, add a screen to show "Vinny" playing against the player inspired by the original game this project was based on 
- Implement bouncy and responsive animations
- Make "Vinny" have some thought and logic so that he is an actual opponent instead of a random number generator
