        "question" : "Imagine you travel back in time to the 1970s to change the history of the internet to your own liking. Based on the events described in the reading, how would you do it? Would you need any funding to achieve the changes you seek? How much? Where do you get that funding from at the time, and how difficult is it to obtain? What does your answer to these questions say about the “great man theory” of history?", 
        "answer": "Although the original purpose of the internet was for the military, there's nothing I can do to change that fact. Funding would have to be sourced from elsewhere which would be nearly impossible given the cold war. Where the US was concerned, attention and research had to be diverted to the effort. One thing I would change was the original denial of the use for military purposes. I don't understand why they wouldn't admit it at first (espionage concerns?) but eventually, it was revealed. Either way, most inventions come from a need to solve a problem or improve repetitive tasks. As well, with it being for the military, funding is practically infinite. I can't physically think of a way I would change the internet. From, the reading, it seems like it was going to an information control route. Although it's easy to access the internet and get any information you want, information is still being controlled/censored. There can never be a truly \"free\" internet. This type of trend will follow any new service that comes in, no matter how you change its past. The only thing I would change is the transparency the government and the researchers give about the internet. For example, in the beginning, I would not deny its military purpose. I believe, without its transparency, people tend to go into conspiracy. As well, the internet is a useful tool and hiding knowledge and research from the public is censorship and goes against America's \"free country\" view."

        "question" : "You live in the newly created country of North Turtle Island. All major online services such as social networking, online shopping, film & television streaming, videogame platforms, etc are currently provided through the internet by tech companies based in the neighboring country to your South, where they keep all their servers. These companies do not provide jobs to any of your fellow citizens, take all the profits they make out of your country, and are so powerful and well-funded that none of the local startups of North Turtle Island are able to compete with them.\nYou’ve been hired by the government to help create a thriving local tech economy and re-design the network infrastructure of your country, which used to be owned by the monopoly conglomerate Omnicorp before the revolution but is now available to be put to the service of your fellow citizens however you propose it be.\nWhat is your proposed course of action?",
        "answer" : "First, we need to make our own internet service provider. (ISP) With this, we can have our own internet access away from the mega corporation. We have to make our own ARPANET, just like Canada tried to do. Like the people in Detroit, we also need to spread the connection with routers around public buildings or peoples houses. Now that we have our own internet, we can build servers. Since were getting help from the local government, funding shouldn't be an issue, however its expensive. Hopefully, with the servers, we can host things on those servers on the internet. It could be local websites, or government things. Either way, the servers will need upkeep. We will need to hire people to do this, and since we have our own servers, we could potentially make the servers cheaper to local tech startups but more expensive to outsiders. This would encourage more jobs, companies, etc to work at North Turtle Island and hire local people."
