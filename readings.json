        "question" : "Imagine you travel back in time to the 1970s to change the history of the internet to your own liking. Based on the events described in the reading, how would you do it? Would you need any funding to achieve the changes you seek? How much? Where do you get that funding from at the time, and how difficult is it to obtain? What does your answer to these questions say about the “great man theory” of history?", 
        "answer": "Although the original purpose of the internet was for the military, there's nothing I can do to change that fact. Funding would have to be sourced from elsewhere which would be nearly impossible given the cold war. Where the US was concerned, attention and research had to be diverted to the effort. One thing I would change was the original denial of the use for military purposes. I don't understand why they wouldn't admit it at first (espionage concerns?) but eventually, it was revealed. Either way, most inventions come from a need to solve a problem or improve repetitive tasks. As well, with it being for the military, funding is practically infinite. I can't physically think of a way I would change the internet. From, the reading, it seems like it was going to an information control route. Although it's easy to access the internet and get any information you want, information is still being controlled/censored. There can never be a truly \"free\" internet. This type of trend will follow any new service that comes in, no matter how you change its past. The only thing I would change is the transparency the government and the researchers give about the internet. For example, in the beginning, I would not deny its military purpose. I believe, without its transparency, people tend to go into conspiracy. As well, the internet is a useful tool and hiding knowledge and research from the public is censorship and goes against America's \"free country\" view."

        "title" : "Week 3: Global Networks",
        "question" : "You live in the newly created country of North Turtle Island. All major online services such as social networking, online shopping, film & television streaming, videogame platforms, etc are currently provided through the internet by tech companies based in the neighboring country to your South, where they keep all their servers. These companies do not provide jobs to any of your fellow citizens, take all the profits they make out of your country, and are so powerful and well-funded that none of the local startups of North Turtle Island are able to compete with them.\nYou've been hired by the government to help create a thriving local tech economy and re-design the network infrastructure of your country, which used to be owned by the monopoly conglomerate Omnicorp before the revolution but is now available to be put to the service of your fellow citizens however you propose it be.\nWhat is your proposed course of action?",
        "answer" : "First, we need to make our own internet service provider. (ISP) With this, we can have our own internet access away from the mega corporation. We have to make our own ARPANET, just like Canada tried to do. Like the people in Detroit, we also need to spread the connection with routers around public buildings or peoples houses. Now that we have our own internet, we can build servers. Since were getting help from the local government, funding shouldn't be an issue, however its expensive. Hopefully, with the servers, we can host things on those servers on the internet. It could be local websites, or government things. Either way, the servers will need upkeep. We will need to hire people to do this, and since we have our own servers, we could potentially make the servers cheaper to local tech startups but more expensive to outsiders. This would encourage more jobs, companies, etc to work at North Turtle Island and hire local people."

        "title": "Week 4: Internet Art",
        "question": "What do you think motivated early internet artists to make art on the internet? What defines success as an artist, in your view? By that metric, which ones of the artists mentioned in the reading do you think are successful? What are some of your favorite pieces of internet art that we might not know about?",
        "answer": "I think on the early internet it was very free to put your personality out there. People were just making their website and putting what they liked on it, what their interested in on it and other things. What we see now as internet art, back then, was just a personal website. I think most people making their websites weren't even thinking that what they were making was art. Having their gifs, layouts and backgrounds making their site unique, was a form of art and expression. In my view, success as an artist is defined by having someone else, anyone else, enjoy and engage in your art. Even if that audience is small, success can be anything one person finds it to be and for me, it's having at least 1 other individual appreciate my work and the time that went into it. I think that's what a lot of other people thought as well. As mentioned in the documentary, the art was communal. Having at least one other person be added to the mailing list or give you suggestions was enough to be considered seen and successful. At least for me, it would."

        "title": "Week 5: Knowledge Sharing and Digital Media Interfaces",
        "question": "It is the year 2030 and you're hired at Concordia University to teach an interactive multimedia course named “Creative Computing & Network Culture”. You have all the technologies of digital media and network computing described in the readings at your disposal to design the most engaging educational experience ever created for your students, and serve as an example of good pedagogy to the entire world. \nDescribe what you create. ",
        "answer": "I don't know how to teach a course or how to make it engaging. I find it interesting and engaging, however, making it interactive. Helps with understanding and fun. In my programming courses at Dawson, many classes were boring. It was just slides of theory and syntax and it was hard to follow. The only time we would then code was in the lab and usually, it was different from the examples in the slides. I had one teacher, however, who was new. Despite having little teaching experience, his class was very engaging. During class, we would still look at slides, but we would also code at the same time. It was a very good way to understand what we were doing, and why and be able to experiment. This helped me and many others pay attention to the course and retain attention. If I were to host a class, I would do the same."

        "title": "Week 6: Intellectual Property",
        "question": " You have been hired to an executive position in the software division of Omnicorp. In recent years, the creative computing lab at Conkers University has been the place where the most exciting new developments in software development are happening. The students there are doing brilliant research and coming up with dozens of amazing new innovations every year. The culture of the student community is strongly influenced by the Free Software movement, and all of its valuable output is licensed under the GNU General Public License, ensuring that any derivative work must also be distributed as free software. \nYou must find a way for Omnicorp to profit from future student research at Conkers U. You have a $1 million CAD budget to achieve this goal, and will lose your job if shareholders do not see a strong return on this investment. The administration of Conkers U. is eager to welcome your donations and contributions to grants and scholarships, and to invite your experts to give career advice on how to succeed in the industry to their students.\nWhat is your strategy?",
        "answer": "Free software doesn't mean that the software isn't free in price. There are lots of free and open-source software that is paid. How do they do this? Well, the paid version has support and gives you the safety that the software works as intended. The \"free\" version is different. If you can download the code and compile it yourself (No matter how many hours that may take) and fix any compiler errors versioning errors and general debugging then congrats, the software is free as in price. There are also opportunities for donations or government support if the project is for the greater good of the public. I would go with the paid version. There are a lot of people who aren't tech-literate and would like to guarantee that the product they are getting is pre-compiled and would work the same on any machine without a difference in the compiler's version or other factors. However, there are also a lot of other people who can do the extra work of compiling the software and being their support. If the software is also open source, it's easy for this person to modify the code to make their experience perfect and add in features that are not in the original software. My partner, for example, is one of these people. He's currently working on customizing his NeoVim and there are a lot of plugins. Some of these plugins don't have features he wished they had, so he makes them himself and makes a pull request. At this point, I think he's listed as a contributor in about 2-3 projects because of his efforts. In a way, he's also providing \"free labour\" which will diminish cost to the company."

        "title": "Week 7: Hacker Culture",
        "question": "The year 2028 and a deadly new virus, \"Super-COVID\", immune to all existing vaccines, is spreading throughout the population. You are a hacker with a day job as a software technician for a university research lab which has been developing a new vaccine capable of stopping this new pandemic and is almost done with trials. You are one of the few people with access to the private server network where the vaccine data is stored.\nThe research is funded by Omnicorp, who will own the patent for the vaccine and fully control its distribution. The scientists who performed the research are worried that poorer countries will not be able to afford Omnicorp's inflated prices, and they believe the vaccine research should be freely available to everyone around the world as soon as it is confirmed safe. \nDo you help them? If so, how? If not, what do you tell them? ",
        "answer": "One thing I would do first is go through the \"normal\" channels and do things right. I would go to higher-ups, make petitions within the company to advocate for the vaccine and its recipe to be freely distributed to the world and especially in poorer countries. I would also try to convince my bosses that they could get government funding to distribute the vaccine for free and give the vaccine for a cost to first world countries and then free or very very reduced price to poorer countries. \nIf that doesn't work, and Omnicorp insists on keeping its capitalist pockets full, I'll leek it. The problem with that is no matter how good I am at covering my traces, it'll be noticeable that it's an inside job and I'm to blame.  If in the few people, then I'm immediately one of the suspects. If I was guaranteed to get away with it, however, for the greater good. I would do it."

        "title": "Week 8: Ideology and Ideology Critique",
        "question": "After graduation, you get hired as a web designer for a successful tech company similar to the ones described in the readings. One day, someone in management makes a mistake and you are given access to a document you shouldn’t have seen, which contains the list of all employees’ salaries. You notice that for the same job position and level of experience, women employees are always paid less than men, on average 20% less. Women represent about 25% of the entire company. Who do you talk to about this? What do you do about the situation? How do you think your bosses will react to your actions?",
        "answer": "Honestly, I am in a dilemma and I am not sure who to approach regarding the situation. While the data should be made public, I was not supposed to see it in the first place. However, it is important for employees to have access to information about their salaries and how they compare to their colleagues and the market. If I were to take action, I would first inform the women mentioned in the document about the information and show them how they compare to their peers. I would also raise my concerns with a union or try to get the company to be under a union. After this, I am not sure what my next step would be. At this point, I would expect to face some consequences for causing a stir and may even lose my job."
