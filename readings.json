        "question" : "Imagine you travel back in time to the 1970s to change the history of the internet to your own liking. Based on the events described in the reading, how would you do it? Would you need any funding to achieve the changes you seek? How much? Where do you get that funding from at the time, and how difficult is it to obtain? What does your answer to these questions say about the “great man theory” of history?", 
        "answer": "Although the original purpose of the internet was for the military, there's nothing I can do to change that fact. Funding would have to be sourced from elsewhere which would be nearly impossible given the cold war. Where the US was concerned, attention and research had to be diverted to the effort. One thing I would change was the original denial of the use for military purposes. I don't understand why they wouldn't admit it at first (espionage concerns?) but eventually, it was revealed. Either way, most inventions come from a need to solve a problem or improve repetitive tasks. As well, with it being for the military, funding is practically infinite. I can't physically think of a way I would change the internet. From, the reading, it seems like it was going to an information control route. Although it's easy to access the internet and get any information you want, information is still being controlled/censored. There can never be a truly \"free\" internet. This type of trend will follow any new service that comes in, no matter how you change its past. The only thing I would change is the transparency the government and the researchers give about the internet. For example, in the beginning, I would not deny its military purpose. I believe, without its transparency, people tend to go into conspiracy. As well, the internet is a useful tool and hiding knowledge and research from the public is censorship and goes against America's \"free country\" view."

        "title" : "Week 3: Global Networks",
        "question" : "You live in the newly created country of North Turtle Island. All major online services such as social networking, online shopping, film & television streaming, videogame platforms, etc are currently provided through the internet by tech companies based in the neighboring country to your South, where they keep all their servers. These companies do not provide jobs to any of your fellow citizens, take all the profits they make out of your country, and are so powerful and well-funded that none of the local startups of North Turtle Island are able to compete with them.\nYou've been hired by the government to help create a thriving local tech economy and re-design the network infrastructure of your country, which used to be owned by the monopoly conglomerate Omnicorp before the revolution but is now available to be put to the service of your fellow citizens however you propose it be.\nWhat is your proposed course of action?",
        "answer" : "First, we need to make our own internet service provider. (ISP) With this, we can have our own internet access away from the mega corporation. We have to make our own ARPANET, just like Canada tried to do. Like the people in Detroit, we also need to spread the connection with routers around public buildings or peoples houses. Now that we have our own internet, we can build servers. Since were getting help from the local government, funding shouldn't be an issue, however its expensive. Hopefully, with the servers, we can host things on those servers on the internet. It could be local websites, or government things. Either way, the servers will need upkeep. We will need to hire people to do this, and since we have our own servers, we could potentially make the servers cheaper to local tech startups but more expensive to outsiders. This would encourage more jobs, companies, etc to work at North Turtle Island and hire local people."

        "title": "Week 4: Internet Art",
        "question": "What do you think motivated early internet artists to make art on the internet? What defines success as an artist, in your view? By that metric, which ones of the artists mentioned in the reading do you think are successful? What are some of your favorite pieces of internet art that we might not know about?",
        "answer": "I think on the early internet it was very free to put your personality out there. People were just making their website and putting what they liked on it, what their interested in on it and other things. What we see now as internet art, back then, was just a personal website. I think most people making their websites weren't even thinking that what they were making was art. Having their gifs, layouts and backgrounds making their site unique, was a form of art and expression. In my view, success as an artist is defined by having someone else, anyone else, enjoy and engage in your art. Even if that audience is small, success can be anything one person finds it to be and for me, it's having at least 1 other individual appreciate my work and the time that went into it. I think that's what a lot of other people thought as well. As mentioned in the documentary, the art was communal. Having at least one other person be added to the mailing list or give you suggestions was enough to be considered seen and successful. At least for me, it would."

        "title": "Week 5: Knowledge Sharing and Digital Media Interfaces",
        "question": "It is the year 2030 and you're hired at Concordia University to teach an interactive multimedia course named “Creative Computing & Network Culture”. You have all the technologies of digital media and network computing described in the readings at your disposal to design the most engaging educational experience ever created for your students, and serve as an example of good pedagogy to the entire world. \nDescribe what you create. ",
        "answer": "I don't know how to teach a course or how to make it engaging. I find it interesting and engaging, however, making it interactive. Helps with understanding and fun. In my programming courses at Dawson, many classes were boring. It was just slides of theory and syntax and it was hard to follow. The only time we would then code was in the lab and usually, it was different from the examples in the slides. I had one teacher, however, who was new. Despite having little teaching experience, his class was very engaging. During class, we would still look at slides, but we would also code at the same time. It was a very good way to understand what we were doing, and why and be able to experiment. This helped me and many others pay attention to the course and retain attention. If I were to host a class, I would do the same."
